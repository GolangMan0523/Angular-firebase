        Greenbroad Suggestion: As an optional step, if you want to double ensure accuracy, you can take your completed
        application to an immigration lawyer for a thorough review. Many lawyers provide remote services if you do not
        want to visit their office. An application review usually takes about 2 - 2.5 hours (1 hour for the lawyer to
        review the forms and documents on his/her own, and another 1 to 1.5 hours to meet with the applicant and sponsor
        remotely or in person). It usually costs around $500. In contrast, hiring a lawyer to do the whole application
        for you can take two months and cost $4,000 and up.
