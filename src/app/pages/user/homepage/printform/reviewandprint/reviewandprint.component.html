        <p>A cover letter is essentially a table of contents of all the forms and documents contained within an
          application packet. A cover letter helps you organize your papers, and also helps USCIS agents during their
          review.</p>
        <p>For easy processing, USCIS advises the application materials be organized into two separate packets:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Petition for Alien Relative packet ‚Äì used by {{us.data.application.sponsorname || "Sponsor"}} to
            establish the existence of a marital relationship with {{us.data.application.name || "Applicant"}}</li>
          <li>The Adjustment of Status packet ‚Äì used by {{us.data.application.name || "Applicant"}} to apply for lawful
            permanent resident status (commonly known as Green Card)</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Below you can download a cover letter for each packet, created based on your input in the <a

                It is your responsibility to review the relevant USCIS instructions on your own to make sure you are
                filing correctly.</li>
