						<p>Since this software is a self-help tool to be used at your specific direction (Greenbroad, LLC is not a law firm and does not have special knowledge of immigration law and procedure), it is your responsibility to make sure your application is filed correctly.

						Greenbroad Suggestion: As an optional step, if you want to double ensure accuracy, you can take your completed application to an immigration lawyer for a thorough review. Many lawyers provide remote services if you do not want to visit their office. An application review usually takes about 2 - 2.5 hours (1 hour for the lawyer to review the forms and documents on his/her own, and another 1 to 1.5 hours to meet with the applicant and sponsor remotely or in person). It usually costs around $500. In contrast, hiring a lawyer to do the whole application for you can take two months and cost $4,000 and up.
						If you need a lawyer recommendation, just contact us üòä
					</span>

					<span class="section__discription">
						That's great! USCIS recommends that you print or save a copy of your completed application to review in the future and for your records.
