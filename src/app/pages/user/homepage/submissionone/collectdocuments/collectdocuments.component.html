    <div class="section__discription">Now it's time to collect the supporting documents that will be submitted with
      Submission 1 ðŸ‘Œ
      In this section, we will help you collect all the necessary supporting documents using a comprehensive checklist.
      All items on this list come from official USCIS instructions. The document items are grouped into the following
      categories:</div>
    <div class="section__container">
      <ul class="section__list">
        <li>Marriage documents</li>
        <li>Proof of 1's Green Card status</li>
        <li>Passport-style photos</li>
        <li>Proof of bona fide marriage</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section__discription">Later in the Submit Application section, we will help you sort these documents
      into correct groups and attach them onto their corresponding application forms. For now, just focus on gathering
      the documents into one place.</div>

        <p>You may submit legible photocopies of the documents requested, unless the USCIS instructions specifically

          or at any time during processing of an application, petition, or request.</p>

        <p>If you submit original documents when not required, different forms handle that different, ranging from
          automatically returning them to you, to returning to you upon request only, to immediately destroying them.

          certification must include the translatorâ€™s signature. The Department of Homeland Security recommends the
