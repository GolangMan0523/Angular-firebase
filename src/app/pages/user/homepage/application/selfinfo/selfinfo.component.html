		<span class="discription-title">What does it mean that an applicant is "likely at any time to become a public charge"?</span>
		<span class="section__discription">TIt means USCIS thinks the applicant will likely, at any point in the future, not have enough income/assets/resources to support him/herself and will become a public charge. (A public charge is someone who receives one or more public benefits for more than 12 months, in total, within any 36-month period). Such an applicant may be denied based on the public charge inadmissibility ground.</span>

		<span class="section__discription">
			<ul>
				<li> <span class="list__title">The applicant's age</span> (if the applicant is younger than 18 or older than 61, that could be a negative factor);</li>
				<li><span class="list__title">The applicant's health</span> (if the applicant's medical exam (Form I-693) lists a Class A medical condition or a Class B medical condition that the civil surgeon, panel physician, or other medical professional indicates is significant enough to interfere with the applicant’s ability to provide and care for him or herself, to attend school, or to work, or that is likely to require extensive medical treatment or institutionalization in the future, then that could be a negative factor);</li>
				<li><span class="list__title">The applicant's family status</span> (more about this coming up);</li>
				<li><span class="list__title">The applicant's assets, resources and financial status</span> (more about this coming up);</li>

				<li><span class="list__title">The presence of heavily weighted positive and negative factors</span> (more about this coming up).</li>
			</ul>
		</span>
		<span class="section__discription">There are various positive and negative factors that USCIS considers in each category, some are weighted more heavily than others. We will walk you through these factors in the following pages. USCIS makes the public charge determination based on the totality of the circumstances. This means that USCIS weighs both the positive and negative factors.</span>

		<span class="section__sub-title">You may consider reviewing your application with an immigration lawyer before submission. Here is how it works:</span>
		<span class="section__discription">After completing your application using Greenbroad, take it to an immigration lawyer and ask for an "application review". Many lawyers provide remote services if you do not want to visit their office. Typically, a lawyer would only charge around $500 for a thorough 2 - 2.5-hour review (1 hour for the lawyer to review the forms and documents on his/her own, and another 1 to 1.5 hours to meet with the applicant and sponsor remotely or in person). In contrast, hiring a lawyer to do the whole application can cost $4,000 and two months.</span>

			<div class="sub-sub__section-inner" *ngIf="subsectioninfo">
				<div class="form__title">Annual Gross Income</div>
				<p>Annual gross income is the total income before any adjustment, taxes, or deductions. This includes wages from employment. This is line 6 “total income” on the 1040 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form. On a Wage and Tax Statement, Form W-2, the total income is in line 1 “Wages, tips, other compensation.” However, a W-2 does not include income from bank account interest, stocks and bond interest, or other income a person may be receiving outside of employment. If a person has multiple jobs with multiple corresponding Forms W-2, the income is added to find the total gross income.</p>

				<div class="form__title">Lawful Sources of Income</div>

				<p>USCIS only considers income sources from legal employment or transactions. USCIS does not consider income derived from illegal activities, whether illegal under federal law or state law, in the calculation of gross annual household income. These sources include, but are not limited to income gained illegally from: gambling, drug sales or trafficking, money laundering, prostitution, and alien smuggling.</p>

				<p>Any income derived from unlawful sources must be deducted from the applicant’s household annual gross income.</p>

				<p>However, income from unauthorized employment should be included in the applicant’s household annual gross income.</p>

				<p>List only the assets that can be converted into cash within 12 months. Provide the value of any asset held in the United States or outside the United States, in U.S. dollars</p>

				<p>If you or a household member owns a home, you may include the net value of your or the household member's home as an asset. The net value of the home is the appraised value of the home, minus the sum of all loans secured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the home. If you wish to include the net value of your or your household member's home, then you must include documentation demonstrating that you or the household member owns it, a recent appraisal by a licensed appraiser, and evidence of the amount of all loans secured by a mortgage, trust deed, or other lien on the home.</p>

				<p>You may not include the net value of an automobile unless you or your household member shows that you or your household member have/has more than one automobile, and at least one automobile is not included as an asset</p>

				<p>If you list assets or resources, submit evidence of the value of your or your household member(s)'s assets. You must include the name of the asset holder, a description of the asset, proof of ownership, and the basis for the owner's claim of its net cash value. Evidence of assets and resources include:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Checking and savings account statements;
					Annuities;</li>
					<li>Stocks and bonds (cash value)/certificates of deposit;</li>
					<li>Retirement accounts and educational accounts;</li>
					<li>Net cash value of real estate holdings; and</li>
					<li>Any other evidence of substantial assets that can be easily converted into cash.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>For checking and savings accounts, you must provide account statements from the bank(s) covering at least 12 months prior to filing the application. You can also provide any documentation from the household members' assets. For additional information, see www.uscis.gov/greencard/public-charge.</p>

			<div class="sub-sub__section-inner" *ngIf="subsectionreditscore">
				<div class="form__title">CREDIT REPORT</div>
				<p>You can obtain a free credit report once a year from each one of the three credit reporting agencies. You are only required to provide one credit report from any of the three nationwide credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Here is how to request it:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Online: Visit AnnualCreditReport.com</li>
					<li>By Phone: Call 1-877-322-8228. For TTY service, call 711 and ask the relay operator for 1-800-821-7232.</li>
					<li>By Mail: Complete the Annual Credit Report Request Form and mail it to:
						Annual Credit Report Request Service
						PO Box 105281
					Atlanta, GA 30348-5281</li>
				</ul>

				<div class="form__title">CREDIT SCORE</div>
				<p>The free annual credit report mentioned above does not include your credit score. According to consumerfinance.gov, there are four main ways to get a credit score:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Check your credit card or other loan statement</li>
					<li>Talk to a non-profit counselor</li>
					<li>Use a credit score service</li>
					<li>Buy a score</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Experian (one of the three credit reporting agencies) appears to offer a free credit score service. However, since the USCIS instructions do not specify what types of credit score documents are acceptable, we cannot advice how you should obtain your credit score document.</p>

			<div class="sub-sub__section-inner" *ngIf="subsectionicreditreport">
				<p>With TransUnion, you can request a letter to prove that you do not have a credit report with them. You can call TransUnion at their general support number listed on their website. Once connected on the phone, press “0” to speak to an agent. The agent will look up your credit report, and if they cannot find your report, they will send you a report saying you do not have any credit at this time. It takes 5-7 business days for them to process the report and mail it to you. You do not need to have a social security number to call them.</p>

				<p>We are not familiar with the procedures with the other two credit agencies, but they may have similar procedures.</p>
