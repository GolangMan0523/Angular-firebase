      {{ us.data.application.name || "Applicant" }} must also answer "Yes" to

        and charges, even if the arrest occurred when
        {{ us.data.application.name || "Applicant" }} was a minor. An
        adjudication of juvenile delinquency is not a “conviction” under U.S.
        immigration law, but a juvenile can be charged as an adult for an
        offense committed while a juvenile. If
        {{ us.data.application.name || "Applicant" }} was convicted as an adult,
        there is a conviction, regardless of whether

        criminal court or a juvenile court. An adjudication of juvenile
        delinquency could also be relevant to the exercise of discretion. If
        {{ us.data.application.name || "Applicant" }} claims that an arrest
        resulted in adjudication of delinquency, and not in a conviction,
        {{ us.data.application.name || "Applicant" }} must submit a copy of the

        less than $500 or points on 1’s driver’s license. However, 1 must submit
        such documentation if the traffic incident resulted in criminal charges
        or involved alcohol, drugs, or injury to a person or property.
