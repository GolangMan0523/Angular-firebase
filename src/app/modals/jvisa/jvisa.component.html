    <p>How to find out if I am subject to this requirement?
        Not all J-1 visa are subject to the two-year foreign residence requirement. You can determine whether your J-1
        is subject by following these rules listed on the <a target="_blank " style="color: #4D61FC;"
            href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/study/exchange/waiver-of-the-exchange-visitor/eligibility.html">Department
            of State website</a></p>
    <p>If it is not clear from these rules whether you are subject, you can also try:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check with your J-1 program sponsor</li>
        <li>Check your J-1 documents:</li>
        <li>On the J-1 visa stamp page in your passport. It may bear the phrase: "Bearer is (or is not) subject to 212(e). Two year rule does/does not apply."</li>
        <li>In the section in the lower left hand corner of your DS-2019 form labeled "preliminary endorsement."</li>
        <li>Take the survey available on the U.S. State Department <a target="_blank " style="color: #4D61FC;" href="https://j1visawaiverrecommendation.state.gov/"> J Visa Waiver Online webpage</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        However, please note that none of these methods guarantee 100% certainty. For an official determination of
        whether you are subject to the two-year foreign residence requirement, you need to request an Advisory Opinion
        form the U.S. State Department. You can learn more about how to obtain an Advisory Opinion here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Getting the Advisory Opinion takes time, so itâ€™s up to you to decide whether to submit your application early
        without the Advisory Opinion, or wait until you get an Advisory Opinion. For your information, Form I-485 is the
        form that asks about the J-1 two-year foreign residence requirement, and the Form I-485 instructions do not list
        an Advisory Opinion as a required document.
